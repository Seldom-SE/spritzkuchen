FIRST IDEA: Rammstein, Gauss, and Mehlhase, all in Lederhosen, went to Munich in their porsche, audi and BMW on their way to visit a famous biergarten in Berlin

Actual Story: 
Rammstein was performing in Berlin.
And then, Mehlhase was like, "what's all this wettbewerbsfaehig-ing noise!?"
When all of a sudden, a Porsche flew over head!
A hund wearing a dirndel ran after it, barking and howling.
The hund stumbled into a Biergartan.
Fed up with this chaos, she got into her BMW and played some musik.
However, the hund was a diehard Rammstein fan, and immediately bolted after Mehlhase as if she was driving a brot.
She was chased all the way to Munich before the hund was distracted by some gebaeck.
